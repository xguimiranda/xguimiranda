Hey, I'm Guilherme Miranda, an Information Systems student at FIAP. I focus on back-end development, system design, problem-solving, clean and scalable code.

While my focus is back-end development, I have the ability to work across the full stack.

Beyond coding, I'm developing a strong understanding of how technology drives business strategy. My studies in Information Systems involve designing, implementing, and managing systems that support decision-making, optimize processes, and generate competitive advantage.
