Hey, I'm Guilherme Miranda, an Information Systems student at FIAP. I focus on back-end development, system design, problem-solving, and clean, scalable code.

While my focus is back-end development, I have the ability to work across the full stack when necessary.

Beyond coding, I'm developing a strong understanding of how technology drives business strategy. My studies in Information Systems involve designing, implementing, and managing systems that support decision-making, optimize processes, and generate competitive advantage.

This includes:
- Business process modeling and its integration with Information Systems.
- Data-driven decision-making, from data capture to information management.
- Applying quantitative and financial approaches to evaluate and optimize systems.
- Understanding CRM, ERP, and Business Intelligence solutions.
- A strategic mindset aligned with Industry 4.0 and modern digital ecosystems.
